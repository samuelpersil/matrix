# matrix
A python's raining code implementation inspired by The Matrix (1999)

### So... what exactly is it?
The Matrix is one of my all-time favorite movies and I've rewatched it several times. Recently, when I was learning a little more about programming, I rewatched (again) this 1999's piece of art and started thinking about the computers of the Nabucodonosor hovercraft, with the relaxing code raining in green font. How did they create that? How did they *code* that? So, in my free time, I decided to code a simple version of this just for fun and it ended up being not only an amusement work, but an opportunity to learn more about Python language and read the docs of Pygame.

I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!

### Versions
This repository has 3 .py files:
* [matrix.py](matrix.py) is the main version of this project. It's a fullscreen implementation, with 24 FPS by default and a color changing functionallity.
* [matrixKeyboard.py](matrixKeyboard.py) is simillar to the first one, but the characters and "rain drops" only fall when you type anything on your keyboard (to act like a hacker in front of your friends).
* [matrixWindowed.py](matrixWindowed.py) is a simpler version of the main one, just to show a windowed demonstration. Some of the recent features, like changing color of characters, may not be avaiable yet.

### How to Use
* `pip install requirements.txt` to install the required libraries
* `python <version>` to run

### Controls
* Press `Space` to change the color of characters
* Press `Esc` to quit the game
